# [130] Surrounded Regions
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions
#
# Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O',
# capture all regions that are 4-directionallyÂ surrounded by 'X'.
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
# Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
# Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border,
# which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
# Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
# Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: board = [["X"]]
# Output: [["X"]]
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# m == board.length
# n == board[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 200
# board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
#
