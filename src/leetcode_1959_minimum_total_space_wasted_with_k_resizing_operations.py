# [1959] Minimum Total Space Wasted With K Resizing Operations
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-space-wasted-with-k-resizing-operations
#
# You are currently designing a dynamic array.You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums,
# where nums[i] is the number of elements that will be in the array at time i.In addition,
# you are given an integer k,the maximum number of times you can resize the array (to any size).
# The size of the array at time t,sizet,
# must be at least nums[t] because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements.
# The space wasted atÂ time t is defined as sizet - nums[t],
# and the total space wasted is the sum of the space wasted across every time t where 0 <= t < nums.
# length.
# Return the minimum total space wasted if you can resize the array at most k times.
# Note: The array can have any size at the start and does not count towards the number of resizing operations.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [10,20], k = 0
# Output: 10
# Explanation: size = [20,20].
# We can set the initial size to be 20.
# The total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) = 10.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [10,20,30], k = 1
# Output: 10
# Explanation: size = [20,20,30].
# We can set the initial size to be 20 and resize to 30 at time 2.
# The total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) + (30 - 30) = 10.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [10,20,15,30,20], k = 2
# Output: 15
# Explanation: size = [10,20,20,30,30].
# We can set the initial size to 10, resize to 20 at time 1, and resize to 30 at time 3.
# The total wasted space is (10 - 10) + (20 - 20) + (20 - 15) + (30 - 30) + (30 - 20) = 15.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 200
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
# 0 <= k <= nums.length - 1
#
#
