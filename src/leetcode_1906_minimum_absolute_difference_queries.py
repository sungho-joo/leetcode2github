# [1906] Minimum Absolute Difference Queries
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-queries
#
# The minimum absolute difference of an array a is defined as the minimum value of |a[i] - a[j]|,
# where 0 <= i < j < a.length and a[i] != a[j].If all elements of a are the same,
# the minimum absolute difference is -1.
#
# For example,the minimum absolute difference of the array [5,2,3,7,2] is |2 - 3| = 1.
# Note that it is not 0 because a[i] and a[j] must be different.
#
# You are given an integer array nums and the array queries where queries[i] = [li,ri].
# For each query i,compute the minimum absolute difference of the subarray nums[li...
# ri] containing the elements of nums between the 0-based indices li and ri (inclusive).
# Return an array ans where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.
# A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements in an array.
# The value of |x| is defined as:
#
# x if x >= 0.
# -x if x < 0.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,3,4,8], queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,3]]
# Output: [2,1,4,1]
# Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
# - queries[0] = [0,1]: The subarray is [1,3] and the minimum absolute difference is |1-3| = 2.
# - queries[1] = [1,2]: The subarray is [3,4] and the minimum absolute difference is |3-4| = 1.
# - queries[2] = [2,3]: The subarray is [4,8] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-8| = 4.
# - queries[3] = [0,3]: The subarray is [1,3,4,8] and the minimum absolute difference is |3-4| = 1.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [4,5,2,2,7,10], queries = [[2,3],[0,2],[0,5],[3,5]]
# Output: [-1,1,1,3]
# Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
# - queries[0] = [2,3]: The subarray is [2,
# 2] and the minimum absolute difference is -1 because all the
#   elements are the same.
# - queries[1] = [0,2]: The subarray is [4,5,2] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-5| = 1.
# - queries[2] = [0,5]: The subarray is [4,5,2,2,7,
# 10] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-5| = 1.
# - queries[3] = [3,5]: The subarray is [2,7,10] and the minimum absolute difference is |7-10| = 3.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
# 1 <= queries.length <= 2Â * 10^4
# 0 <= li < ri < nums.length
#
