# [2047] Number of Valid Words in a Sentence
# Difficulty: Easy
# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-valid-words-in-a-sentence
#
# A sentence consists of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'),digits ('0' to '9'),hyphens ('-'),
# punctuation marks ('!','.',and ','),and spaces (' ') only.
# Each sentence can be broken down into one or more tokens separated by one or more spaces ' '.
# A token is a valid word if:
#
# It only contains lowercase letters, hyphens, and/or punctuation (no digits).
# There is at most one hyphen '-'.If present,
# it should be surrounded by lowercase characters ("a-b" is valid,but "-ab" and "ab-" are not valid).
# There is at most one punctuation mark. If present, it should be at the end of the token.
#
# Examples of valid words include "a-b.", "afad", "ba-c", "a!", and "!".
# Given a string sentence, return the number of valid words in sentence.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: sentence = "cat and  dog"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The valid words in the sentence are "cat", "and", and "dog".
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: sentence = "!this  1-s b8d!"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There are no valid words in the sentence.
# "!this" is invalid because it starts with a punctuation mark.
# "1-s" and "b8d" are invalid because they contain digits.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: sentence = "alice and  bob are playing stone-game10"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The valid words in the sentence are "alice", "and", "bob", "are", and "playing".
# "stone-game10" is invalid because it contains digits.
#
# Example 4:
#
# Input: sentence = "he bought 2 pencils, 3 erasers, and 1  pencil-sharpener."
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The valid words in the sentence are "he","bought","pencils,","erasers,","and",
# and "pencil-sharpener.".
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= sentence.length <= 1000
# sentence only contains lowercase English letters, digits, ' ', '-', '!', '.', and ','.
# There will be at leastÂ 1 token.
