# [1648] Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/sell-diminishing-valued-colored-balls
#
# You have an inventory of different colored balls,
# and there is a customer that wants orders balls of any color.
# The customer weirdly values the colored balls.
# Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that colorÂ you currently have in your inventory.
# For example,if you own 6 yellow balls,the customer would pay 6 for the first yellow ball.
# After the transaction,there are only 5 yellow balls left,
# so the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e.,
# the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).
# You are given an integer array,inventory,
# where inventory[i] represents the number of balls of the ith color that you initially own.
# You are also given an integer orders,
# which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants.
# You can sell the balls in any order.
# Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling orders colored balls.
# As the answer may be too large,return it modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
# Output: 14
# Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).
# The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: inventory = [3,5], orders = 6
# Output: 19
# Explanation: Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).
# The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: inventory = [2,8,4,10,6], orders = 20
# Output: 110
#
# Example 4:
#
# Input: inventory = [1000000000], orders = 1000000000
# Output: 21
# Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1000000000 times for a total value of 500000000500000000.
# 500000000500000000 modulo 109 + 7 = 21.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9
# 1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 10^9)
#
