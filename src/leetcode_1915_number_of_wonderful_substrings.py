# [1915] Number of Wonderful Substrings
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-wonderful-substrings
#
# A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times.
#
# For example, "ccjjc" and "abab" are wonderful, but "ab" is not.
#
# Given a string word that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters ('a' through 'j'),
# return the number of wonderful non-empty substrings in word.
# If the same substring appears multiple times in word,then count each occurrence separately.
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: word = "aba"
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The four wonderful substrings are underlined below:
# - "aba" -> "a"
# - "aba" -> "b"
# - "aba" -> "a"
# - "aba" -> "aba"
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: word = "aabb"
# Output: 9
# Explanation: The nine wonderful substrings are underlined below:
# - "aabb" -> "a"
# - "aabb" -> "aa"
# - "aabb" -> "aab"
# - "aabb" -> "aabb"
# - "aabb" -> "a"
# - "aabb" -> "abb"
# - "aabb" -> "b"
# - "aabb" -> "bb"
# - "aabb" -> "b"
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: word = "he"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The two wonderful substrings are underlined below:
# - "he" -> "h"
# - "he" -> "e"
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= word.length <= 10^5
# word consists of lowercase English letters from 'a'Â to 'j'.

            ans += mask_count[mask]

                ans += mask_count[mask ^ 1 << i]
            mask_count[mask] += 1
