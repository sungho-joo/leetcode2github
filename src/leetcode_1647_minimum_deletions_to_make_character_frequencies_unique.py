# [1647] Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique
#
# A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.
# Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.
# The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string.
# For example,in the string "aab",the frequency of 'a' is 2,while the frequency of 'b' is 1.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "aab"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: s is already good.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
# Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
# Example 3:
#
# Input: s = "ceabaacb"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
# Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e.
# frequency of 0 is ignored).
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
# sÂ contains only lowercase English letters.
