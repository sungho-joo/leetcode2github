# [126] Word Ladder II
# Difficulty: Hard
# https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii
#
# A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> .
# ..-> sk such that:
#
# Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
# Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
# sk == endWord
#
# Given two words,beginWord and endWord,and a dictionary wordList,
# return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord,
# or an empty list if no such sequence exists.
# Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord,s1,s2,...,sk].
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
# Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
# Explanation:Â There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
# "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
# "hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
# Output: []
# Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList,
# therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
# endWord.length == beginWord.length
# 1 <= wordList.length <= 1000
# wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
# beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
# beginWord != endWord
# All the words in wordList are unique.
