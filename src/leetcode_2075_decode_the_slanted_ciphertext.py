# [2075] Decode the Slanted Ciphertext
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-the-slanted-ciphertext
#
# A string originalText is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a string encodedText with the help of a matrix having a fixed number of rows rows.
# originalText is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner.
#
# The blue cells are filled first,followed by the red cells,then the yellow cells,and so on,
# until we reach the end of originalText.The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled.
# All empty cells are filled with ' '.
# The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will not be empty after filling in originalText.
# encodedText is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion.
#
# The characters in the blue cells are appended first to encodedText,then the red cells,and so on,
# and finally the yellow cells.The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are accessed.
# For example, if originalText = "cipher" and rows = 3, then we encode it in the following manner:
#
# The blue arrows depict how originalText is placed in the matrix,
# and the red arrows denote the order in which encodedText is formed.In the above example,
# encodedText = "ch ie pr".
# Given the encoded string encodedText and number of rows rows,
# return the original string originalText.
# Note: originalText does not have any trailing spaces ' '.
# The test cases are generated such that there is only one possible originalText.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: encodedText = "ch   ie   pr", rows = 3
# Output: "cipher"
# Explanation: This is the same example described in the problem description.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: encodedText = "iveo    eed   l te   olc", rows = 4
# Output: "i love leetcode"
# Explanation: The figure above denotes the matrix that was used to encode originalText.
# The blue arrows show how we can find originalText from encodedText.
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: encodedText = "coding", rows = 1
# Output: "coding"
# Explanation: Since there is only 1 row, both originalText and encodedText are the same.
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: encodedText = " b  ac", rows = 2
# Output: " abc"
# Explanation: originalText cannot have trailing spaces, but it may be preceded by one or more spaces.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 0 <= encodedText.length <= 10^6
# encodedText consists of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.
# encodedText is a valid encoding of some originalText that does not have trailing spaces.
# 1 <= rows <= 1000
# The testcases are generated such that there is only one possible originalText.
