# [1770] Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-performing-multiplication-operations
#
# You are given two integer arrays nums and multipliers of size n and m respectively,where n >= m.
# The arrays are 1-indexed.
# You begin with a score of 0.You want to perform exactly m operations.
# On the ith operation (1-indexed),you will:
#
# Choose one integer x from either the start or the end of the array nums.
# Add multipliers[i] * x to your score.
# Remove x from the array nums.
#
# Return the maximum score after performing m operations.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
# Output: 14
# Explanation:Â An optimal solution is as follows:
# - Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
# - Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
# - Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
# The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
# Output: 102
# Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
# - Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.
# - Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
# - Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
# - Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
# - Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score.
# The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# n == nums.length
# m == multipliers.length
# 1 <= m <= 10^3
# m <= n <= 10^5
# -1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000
#
#
