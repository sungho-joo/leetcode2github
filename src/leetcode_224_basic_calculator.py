# [224] Basic Calculator
# Difficulty: Hard
# https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator
#
# Given a string s representing a valid expression,implement a basic calculator to evaluate it,
# and return the result of the evaluation.
# Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions,
# such as eval().
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "1 + 1"
# Output: 2
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
# Output: 3
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
# Output: 23
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 3Â * 10^5
# s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
# s represents a valid expression.
# '+' is not used as a unary operation.
# '-' could be used as a unary operation but it has to be inside parentheses.
# There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
# Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
