# [1864] Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the Binary String Alternating
# Difficulty: Medium
# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-binary-string-alternating
#
# Given a binary string s,return the minimum number of character swaps to make it alternating,
# or -1 if it is impossible.
# The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.For example,
# the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating,while the string "0100" is not.
# Any two characters may be swapped, even if they areÂ not adjacent.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "111000"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Swap positions 1 and 4: "111000" -> "101010"
# The string is now alternating.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "010"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The string is already alternating, no swaps are needed.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: s = "1110"
# Output: -1
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
#
